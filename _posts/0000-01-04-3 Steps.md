1. Search indexes evolved as a sorted “master list” of the websites and
pages of each website currently available on the WWW, found
by the Internet crawlers a search engine employs to get the data in the
first place.

2. Once a user enters a search term or phrase, it is evaluated by the search
engine, which tries to understand what the term means and identify any
misspellings present.

3. The most relevant pages in the search index are matched with the query
and served up to the user by the search engine, operating on its unique
set of search algorithms.
